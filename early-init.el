;;; early-init.el --- Emacs early init -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs 27 introduced early-init.el, which is run before init.el, before
;; package and UI initialization happens.

;;; Code:
;; (setq init-file-debug t)
;; (setq messages-buffer-max-lines 100000)

;; If an `.el' file is newer than its corresponding `.elc', load the `.el'.
(setq load-prefer-newer t)

;; Set Garbage Collection threshold to 1GB during startup. `gcmh' will clean
;; things up later.
(setq gc-cons-threshold 1073741824
      gc-cons-percentage 0.6)

;; Write any customizations to a temp file so they are discarded.
(setq custom-file (make-temp-file "custom-" nil ".el"))

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)
;; (push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
;; (push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)

;; Give the frame basic coloring while waiting for the theme to load. The main
;; purpose of this is to not blind me when it's dark by flashing a screen full
;; of white. These colors are from doom-one.
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :background "#282c34" :foreground "#bbc2cf")
;; Default frame settings. This is actually maximized, not full screen.
(push '(fullscreen . maximized) initial-frame-alist)
(push '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t) default-frame-alist)
          
;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t
      frame-resize-pixelwise t)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

(provide 'early-init)
